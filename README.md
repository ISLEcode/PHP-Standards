## PHP Quality assurance and coding style

Rather then reinventing the wheel we have taken the commonly discussed and adopted _PHP standard recommendations_ (PSR)
maintained by the [PHP Framework Interoperability Group][php-fig] (PHP-FIG) and customised them for our purposes and toolchains.

As clearly stated by the PHP-FIG, their standardisation efforts our for collaboration a closed set of PHP projects:

> Our main audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community is watching. If other folks want to
> adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim.

While we adhere to the majority of the commonalities they have standardised, some are considered -- for our purposes, non
practical or in violation of our quality assurance and code base as established, and evolved, over almost four decades and using
many different programming languages. Hence the purpose of this repository to amend their works accordingly.

This is made available primarily for our staff and partners. However we know that some of our decisions are _non conventional_
in our industry today. Discussions on such topics is open. We are open to positive criticism, and under valid arguments, could
adjust over time. Note however that animating discussions will be on a best effort basis.
